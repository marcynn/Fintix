## Description
Quantitative statistics &amp; analytics dash application for comparing investment strategies and assets. 

It is built on top of @ranaroussi's [quantstats](https://github.com/ranaroussi/quantstats) library and provides an easy and interactive experience for investment analytics. 

## Usage
The current version is based on uploading an excel template of asset prices time series. I am planning on adding additional funcitonalities and modules in the future such as integrating yfinance.

The excel template / data sample can be downloaded from the app for reference. The format is a date column called "Date" followed by assets columns containing asset prices.

Once the data is uploaded and the user submits, the dashboard will be initialized with parameters that can be adjusted on the fly and multiple modules such as "Compare", "Returns", "Benchmark", and "Rolling" metrics.
